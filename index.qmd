## What is Technology?

::: {.incremental}

"Web3 is amazing&nbsp;[ technology]{.rn}!"

1. Hardware or artifacts
2. Sociotechnical system of manufacture
3. Knowledge, technique, know-how, or methodology
4. Sociotechnical system of use

:::

::: {.notes}

So let's address these one at a time. Why? Think about this phrase: "Web3 is amazing technology." Can you, just at first blush, determine which *technology* is being referred to? Exactly.

### Hardware or Artifacts

Possible denotation: non-natural objects, of all kinds, manufactured by humans.

Kline [-@klineWhatTechnology1985] says, "Engineers often call manufactured articles 'hardware;' anthropologists usually call them 'artifacts.'

### Sociotechnical System of Manufacture

Possible denotation: All the elements needed to manufacture a particular kind of hardware, the complete working system including its inputs: people; machinery; resources; processes; and legal, economic, political and physical environment.

It is "much more than just the machinery and the people" but is the synergistic totality of these elements.

### Knowledge, Technique, Know-how, or Methodology

The information, skills, processes, and procedures for accomplishing tasks. It is just what it sounds like. The best example of this is probably the classic *Six Million Dollar Man* introduction:

>Steve Austin, astronaut. A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. **We have the technology**. We have the capability to build the world's first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before. Better, stronger, faster." â€” The Six Million Dollar Man, Opening Narration.

So, not just the hardware, not just the ability, but *the know-how to accomplish the task*.

### A Sociotechnical System of Use

A system using combinations of hardware, people (and usually other elements) to accomplish tasks that humans cannot perform unaided by such systems -- to extend human capacities.

+ Example that is most pertinent to us: "We build microscopes, telescopes, cat-scanners, thermometers, and other instruments and utilize them in systems to extend our ability to sense various aspects of the world around us."
+ It's not just "the system" but what the system allows us to do.
+ We wouldn't know how to create a band without the knowledge that comes from and after creating an instrument.
+ "Without sociotechnical system of use, the manufacture of hardware would have no purpose."

Folks often have difficulty even describing what Web3 is, right? Perhaps this is why. Now let's return to our question: when we say, "Web3 is amazing technology," does it change how you understand the question, itself? Something to ponder.

Here, the person more or less incorporates the technology into their outward, physical, proprioreceptory experience. A classic example is a blind cane. The cane, in essence, becomes an extension of themselves and their perception. Likewise, glasses or a telescope.

The hermeneutic relation, on the otherhand, involves *translating* or *interpreting* technology in order to understand the world. You essentially *read through* the artifact, such as a speedometer or a clock. Writing, itself, is a technology that falls within this category. (Kline, remember?)

::: {.notes}

Here we start getting into more complex relations that you can imagine being used in cutting-edge or future online/virtual learning environments. Hopefully you're beginning to see where I'm going with all this.

+ First, **fusion** or a **cyborg** intentionality. Here we're talking about everything from IUDs to pacemakers, from implanted RFID chips to cochlear implants. In this case, there is no physical separation of the self and the technology. In fact, removing one of them from the equation breaks the entire thing down. A pacemaker without a user has no impact, and a user without a pacermaker is... well. You get the point. The person and the technology are literally **fused** insofar as experiencing the world is concerned.
+ **Composite** intentionality: `Human -> ( Technology -> World )`, wherein a person's intention is directed toward the technology, and that technology's *intention* is thereby directed at the world. While a thermometer *represents* the temperature in the hermeneutic relation, A thermal camera, for example, which translates a world we cannot naturally perceive (infrared radiation) into something we can (a colorful video) in the composite relation.
+ **Augmented** intentionality: considerably more complex, it includes a kind of feedback loop, wherein the human's intention directs the technology experience the world, the results of which are then fed back to the human and the cycle repeats itself. So, not only is the human experiencing the world through the technology, the human is also experiencing the technology's experience of the world overlaid, and reacts to *that*.

The question, then, is how many of these different kind of technological relations can you identify in this experience, alone, much less in the myriad "technologies" (remember Kline?) that make up Web3 in general.

First, literally every experience you have in and through the metaverse is mediated by and through some technology. It's a necessary case in that context. Now consider the complexity of of that technology. The "metaverse," *in toto*, is *itself* an actor in this mashup of intentionalities. The metaverseâ€“and any degree of extended or mixed realities, reallyâ€“is a filter for others, a translation in ways that are well beyond our control, even though we may be the target. The subject, the object, the mediation that connects them, are all co-constituted through the experiential process.

Second, once we begin incorporating digital identitiesâ€“wherein, as far as the world is concerned, *you* and the *all-encompassing digital representation of you*, are one and the sameâ€“this mediation becomes even more important to consider.

**This process is not neutral**. This is **key**. The pathway between you and the "other" you are engaging with, whether that is a person or simply some collection of information, is not some transparent wormhole through which unadulterated, unfiltered data is fed. There will *always* be some alteration.

+ Who designed the platform you're using? For whom?
+ Who designed the devices you're using? For whom?
+ What affordances or friction is there?
+ Does engaging through this medium actually *invite* anything unintentional and undesired?
+ What are the impacts of these?

Each "actor" or intentional step we introduce to this network introduces *another* intention. These can be complementary, supplementary, contradictory, or mutually exclusive, but *never* neutral.

If one of the points of educat*ing* and educat*ion* is to reach truths and explore those truths (small-t truths), this obviously needs to be considered in the fundamental way your experiences and even reality (and the experiences and reality of those at the other end of the interaction) are changing. This is especially true in the case of immersive technologies, as they are, cognitively-speaking, *very* convincing. This goes *well* beyond just the interface.

## Doing Postphenomenology

>... in education involves attending to the unique differences a particular technology makes to teaching practice, knowledge apprehension, and pedagogical meaning.

. . .

But what about the **digital self**?

::: {.notes}
As Adams and Turville [-@adamsDoingPostphenomenologyEducation2018] point out, "Doing postphenomenology in education involves attending to the unique differences a particular technology makes to teaching practice, knowledge apprehension, and pedagogical meaning" (p. 20). The question then becomes, in this new version of technologically-mediated learning *and of self*, what are these Web3 paradigms of teaching practice, knowledge apprehension, and pedagogical meaning? 

Approaching learning in this wayâ€“that is, through a postphenomenological, posthuman inquiry lensâ€“encourages us to scrape away at the outer encompassing veneer of the *digital self* and critically examine the delineation therein, harkening back to the traditional phenomenological "way in." Crucially, *doing* postphenomenology has no actual, agreed-upon method [@rosenbergerFieldGuidePostphenomenology2015]. There are a variety of *suggested* heuristics [@adamsResearchingPosthumanWorld2016], but no hard-and-fast checklist or guide.

That said, there are a couple approaches we can take:

1. Variational method or analysis: described as "the method of brainstorming stabilities of a multistable technology." Remember, everything is also something else.
2. Variational cross-examination: first determining what a particular technology's "dominant" stability is, we can move on to critically examining and identifying alternatives by exploring, for example, habits of users or frequent qualities teased out of the technology itself, its role in a particular system (thinking back to it being just an actor in a network of actors), and what we are probably most comfortable with or at least what we tend to do in this Web3 space: what's known as "tailoring," or "the â€¦ alterations of technology for different purposes." Just think about how often we approach things in this space that way: "this has potential; how can we use it?"
3. Third, case study: generally speaking the postphenomenological approach is this. The Ed3DAO, for example, is a perfect candidate for this kind of approach, but so is something like the various platforms focusing on self-sovereign identity and data portability like Disco.
4. Finally, conversational analysis. This can be a little heady, but it can help us bridge the gap between simply exploring "what things do" and those mediations of our perceptions and actions "from within."

So, again, as you can see, there is no hard and fast, prescriptive method to take. This, perhaps surprisingly, works in our favor. It requires the educator and researcher to delve deep to fully understand something that they likely never will, only the individual instance of the thing. In doing so, however, incorporating the posthuman inquiry approach, we can interview these objectsâ€“whether tangible devices, virtual worlds, or digital personasâ€“and give them time to "speak." We musn't simply explore how, for example, students "use" these things; we must conversely look at how those things use *them*.
