  abstract = {We reflect on the many digital and nondigital things that support and shepherd today's professional practices. Things are not inert objects, but vital entities implicated in the co-constitution and becoming of our everyday worlds. We forward posthumanism as a theoretical framework to address our twenty-first century situation. Actor-Network Theory, phenomenology, and related methodological approaches used throughout the book are presented. Differences between objects and things are considered. We propose interviewing objects as a way to give things a voice in research, and thus include them as participants in inquiry. Eight heuristics are introduced for conducting posthuman research.},

  abstract = {In the late 20th century, there is only one thing most people agree about concerning technology -- it is important. It is discussed almost as much as the weather, and sometimes it seems, with as little effect. But what is 'technology?' If we look with even a little care, we find this same word is being used to represent things, actions, processes, methods and systems. 'Technology' is also used symbolically as an epithet, for important working procedures, and to represent progress. This much conflict within the usage of one of our central terms won't do; it can lead only to chaos. Even more important, the current vague use of the word 'technology' hides from view two central concepts,and a central pattern of human behavior that we must have to make sense of our views of many critical questions in the current world including how we understand innovation, how we can communicate across Snow's culture gap, and how we understand the way in which we humans make our living on the planet.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article investigates the types of intentionality involved in humantechnology relations. It aims to augment Don Ihdes analysis of the relations between human beings and technological artifacts, by analyzing a number of concrete examples at the limits of Ihdes analysis. The article distinguishes and analyzes three types of cyborg intentionality, which all involve specific blends of the human and the technological. Technologically mediated intentionality occurs when human intentionality takes place through technological artifacts; hybrid intentionality occurs when the technological actually merges with the human; and composite intentionality is the addition of human intentionality and the intentionality of technological artifacts.},
